Robocode Project

Description:
  From https://robocode.sourceforge.io/: 
    Robocode is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

Goals:
- Demonstrate knowledge of basic Java concepts
- Create a fun game using Java
- Utilize an API for the first time: https://robocode.sourceforge.io/docs/robocode/
- Explore AI and machine learning for the first time

Thoughts:
This was a fun little game I created using the Robocode API. As a first project in Java, this was a great experience in demonstrating concepts I learned. It was also a great first experience in AI used in games on the surface.
